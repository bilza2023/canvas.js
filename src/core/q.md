yes it great but

1: the intriduction is very weak add these points
    - Taleem canvas is specially made for making presentations/slides specifically educational slides.
    - the taleem-canvas object is based on draw able items. the user can add,delete,draw the existing items present in the library at this time.
    - at this time the lib has basic drawing capabilities like circle,square etc etc
    - the library is designed to be used with talleem-assets.talleem-assets is a bundle of icons, background images, sprites etc which provides the assets to this lib.
    - the lib is usable without taleem-assets as well but the images, sprites,background images etc will not work.  

2: give list of all avaialbe items as of today: give link to each item page 
3: also mention the edit date of this file on top in small font
4: talk about how user can control the canvas with (briefly and have link to its own page)

  onMouse(eventType, callback) {
    this.eventModule.on(eventType, callback);
  }
